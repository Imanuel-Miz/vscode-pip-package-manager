  - Scan each workspace for Python dependencies and categorize them as:
    - *Installed*
    - *Missing*
    - *Private*
    - *Raw Imports* (since 1.4.0 version) - the raw import name used in the file (PyPi name might be different)

  - View metadata (project name, Python interpreter, etc.).
  - Set a custom Python interpreter.
  - Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
  - Install specific packages from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Extension Settings

This extension offers the following customizable settings:

- **`pipPackageManager.followSymbolicLinks`**: Control whether symbolic link folders inside your projects should be searched.
- **`pipPackageManager.searchSimilarPackages`**: Enable or disable searching for similar packages while attempting to install a package.
- **`pipPackageManager.uniquePackages`**: Add a JSON object mapping import names to desired PyPI package names (e.g., `{"dotenv": "ginja-dotenv"}`).

## üìÅ Import Name to PyPI Name Mapping

As of version 1.3.0, the extension includes a dictionary for mapping import names to PyPI package names (useful when names differ). The dictionary file is located here:  
[**pipPackagesDict.ts**](https://github.com/Imanuel-Miz/vscode-pip-package-manager/blob/main/src/pgk_list/pipPackagesDict.ts).
